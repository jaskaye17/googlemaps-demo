===============

Google map demo of some common features using javascript and ember.js

In this demo I am going to go through the setup of a google map using the google map api. 
I will also add a few features that I have found useful.
SPECIFICALLY, this demo will:

1.  Create the Map itself and display it in the browser

2.  Use geolocation to get current position

3.  Set a marker on the map

4.  Perform a search for nearby places

5.  Add additional markers with Alphabetic numbering
